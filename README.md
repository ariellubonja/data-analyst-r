# Data Analyst R

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariellubonja/data-analyst-r.git
cd data-analyst-r
```

### 2. Install the Required Python Packages

If a `requirements.txt` file is provided, install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, manually install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install rpy2 openai autogen_core autogen_ext autogen_agentchat
```

### 3. Set Your OpenAI API Key

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

On Windows (Command Prompt):

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### `human_in_the_loop_rpy2.py`

This script demonstrates an interactive agent system using `rpy2` for in-process R code execution.

#### **What It Does:**
- **Assistant Agent**: Generates R code wrapped in a triple backtick code fence (```r ... ```).
- **Executor Agent**: Extracts and executes the R code using `rpy2`, capturing console output and errors.
- **Human Feedback Loop**: Allows corrections or new instructions until the analysis is complete.

#### **How to Run:**
```bash
python human_in_the_loop_rpy2.py
```

The script starts with an initial task, e.g.:

```
Compute mean and standard deviation from the 'aorta' column in dsc.csv. Then say 'DONE'.
```

You can provide additional feedback or corrections after each cycle. Press **Enter** on an empty input to exit.

### `single_file_agent.py`

This script implements a self-contained, iterative chat system using a **Round Robin** architecture.

#### **What It Does:**
- **RCoderAgent**: Generates and refines R code iteratively based on feedback.
- **RExecutorAgent**: Identifies R code in messages and executes it using the systemâ€™s `Rscript` command via a temporary file.
- **Termination Conditions**: The system stops when:
  - `RCoderAgent` outputs `"DONE"`, or
  - A set number of message exchanges is reached.

#### **How to Run:**
```bash
python single_file_agent.py
```

The agents will interact, generating and executing R code until the task is successfully completed.
